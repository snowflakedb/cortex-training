# Run GRPO from SkyRL

[SkyRL](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL) can run GRPO against Cortex
Training. SkyRL's trainer drives the loop from your machine while Cortex runs
training and sampling as separate sub-jobs, so the driver needs no local GPU.

The example below trains Qwen3-0.6B on GSM8K. It lives in the Arctic Platform
repository rather than under `recipes/` here, and SkyRL's entry point drives it
rather than this client's.

## Prerequisites

A Cortex account with capacity for 8 GPUs: 4 for training and 4 for sampling.
Follow [connection setup](../getting-started/setup.md) to create
`~/cortex-training-config.json` and log in, then confirm capacity:

```bash
cortex-training login ~/cortex-training-config.json
cortex-training capacity
```

The driver machine needs no GPU, about 16 GB of free RAM, and a few gigabytes
of disk for the `uv` cache. Ray reports too little memory as an OOM kill during
the evaluation that precedes training, rather than as a clear error.

## Install

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env   # if uv is not already on your PATH

git clone https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL
git -C SkyRL checkout skyrl-v0.3.0
export SKYRL_HOME=$PWD/SkyRL

git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-AI-Research/Arctic-Platform
cd Arctic-Platform/recipes/rl/skyrl/simple_gsm8k_cortex
```

## Configure

```bash
cfg=~/cortex-training-config.json
export ARCTIC_CORTEX_HOST=$(jq -r .host "$cfg")
export ARCTIC_CORTEX_DATABASE=$(jq -r .database "$cfg")
export ARCTIC_CORTEX_SCHEMA=$(jq -r .schema "$cfg")
export ARCTIC_CORTEX_PAT=$(jq -r .pat "$cfg")
```

## Run

```bash
uv run --isolated --no-project --with datasets \
  python ../simple_gsm8k/download_data.py --output_dir ${HOME}/data/gsm8k-skyrl

bash run_qwen3_0.6b_gsm8k_grpo_cortex.sh
```

The first training step lands about twenty minutes in on a fresh machine:
roughly six minutes of wheel downloads, four to seven provisioning Cortex
sub-jobs, two tokenizing the dataset, and four on the evaluation that runs
before training. Later launches reach it about five minutes sooner, once `uv`
serves the wheels from cache.

## Results

One epoch is 233 steps and takes two to three hours. `eval/all/pass_at_1` is
scored on the 1319-example GSM8K test set every 10 steps, and should track
roughly:

| Step | pass@1 |
|---|---|
| 1 | 0.31 |
| 20 | 0.50 |
| 40 | 0.67 |
| 60 | 0.71 |
| 80 | 0.71 |
| 100 | 0.72 |
| 120 | 0.73 |

## Resume a stopped run

Checkpoints land every ten steps under `~/checkpoints`, but the launcher starts
fresh by default. To continue from the last one:

```bash
bash run_qwen3_0.6b_gsm8k_grpo_cortex.sh trainer.resume_mode=latest
```

Arguments are forwarded to the trainer, so this overrides the default. From a
new terminal, re-export `SKYRL_HOME` and the four `ARCTIC_CORTEX_*` values
first; the dataset and checkpoints are still on disk. The reload itself is
unverified here: the checkpoints are written, but no Cortex run has been
restarted from one.

## More detail

The
[recipe README](https://github.com/Snowflake-AI-Research/Arctic-Platform/blob/main/recipes/rl/skyrl/simple_gsm8k_cortex/README.md)
covers hyperparameters, the flags that differ from the on-prem sibling recipe,
and troubleshooting.
